 Prologue: Origin of the Shattered - Placeholder

In the dwindling years of Earth, humanity faced extinction due to cataclysmic events and rampant diseases. Factions emerged, each seeking a solution to ensure survival in new star systems. 

One of many such factions chose the Eldrath systems. 

Majority of humans from that faction embraced the harsh environment of the chosen planet Forgeheim - rich on resources and dangers, becoming the Dwarves. 

A few from the original faction sought refuge on a moon of Forgeheim - Luminara, unlocking the latent magical energies, evolving into the Elves. 

The third faction, comprised of criminals and the violent, was exiled to a neighboring planet Exilium, ultimately transforming into the Orcs.

To survive the harsh conditions of their new homes, each faction turned to technology. Over time, they became pioneers in the fusion of magic and machinery. However, this reliance on technological enhancements led to a schism, with some factions pursuing immortality through dark rituals and forbidden technologies. These factions eventually gave rise to the Veilstitchers and the Technomancers, each driven by a desire to transcend mortality.
